# nodechat

An app written in Rust: its UI is `src/lib.rs`, and `nsh.json` names the root component (`"root": "App"`).

```sh
nsh run                      # this machine's backend; --target ios, android, web, macos, linux or windows
nsh check                    # cargo check of the crate, then type checks App.test.tsx
nsh test                     # cargo test, then App.test.tsx: the root tested from TypeScript, headless; --target to run it on a platform
nsh test nsh.json --trace    # headless: what the root mounts, and the time of each commit
nsh package --target web     # or ios, android, macos, linux, windows
```

`nsh run` and `nsh package` mount the root on every platform, the browser included, without QuickJS: the app is Rust
and native code from start to end (in the browser, with NSH's page script). Rust edits rebuild and restart the app.

```sh
cargo run
```

This starts the root directly on the machine's native desktop backend: GTK 4 on Linux, AppKit on macOS, Win32 on
Windows. Install the backend's development libraries before building.

## Desktop and phone navigation

On wide windows, a compact section rail sits beside a dedicated chat list and conversation pane. At medium widths,
section navigation and the chat list share a sidebar. Contacts and Settings replace the conversation pane without
hiding the chat list. New chat and the empty pane's Browse contacts action open the peer list; selecting a peer returns
to its conversation. Search filters chats by name and latest-message preview. On phones, the same sections use bottom
tabs and conversations open as pushed screens.

The sample conversations have locally simulated sending so the composer can be exercised before the transport and
persistence layers are connected.

The current screens use sample data while the transport and persistence layers are developed.

The `nsh` commands build the app's runners from the NSH crates `Cargo.toml` depends on: crates.io's at the version of
the `nsh` you run (keep the `nsh-*` dependencies at that version when you upgrade `nsh`), or an NSH checkout's by path.

## Adding a TSX entry

TSX screens can use the Rust components and modules, with hot reloading for the TSX. The crate's set,
`#[native_module("nodechat/native")]` in `src/lib.rs`, already exports `App`. Add an `App.tsx`:

```tsx
import { mount } from "nsh";
import { App } from "nodechat/native";

mount(App);
```

then run it with `nsh run App.tsx` (`tsconfig.json` is there for it and the test): a named TSX entry
runs on QuickJS, while `nsh run` alone keeps running the Rust root. The first `nsh build App.tsx` writes the TypeScript
declarations of `nodechat/native` into `.nsh/types`. Register more with `registry.register::<…>()` (components),
`registry.module::<…>()` and `registry.class::<…>()`.

NSH-generated files stay in `.nsh/`: runner sources in `.nsh/rust/` and default packages in `.nsh/out/`.
Cargo keeps its normal `target/` directory and respects your existing `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`.
